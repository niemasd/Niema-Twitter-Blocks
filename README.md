# Niema-Twitter-Blocks
An archive of Niema's Twitter blocks. The main data file is [`block.js.gz`](block.js.gz), which is (a gzip-compressed version of) a file from my Twitter data archive (obtained using Twitter's ["Download an archive of your data"](https://twitter.com/settings/download_your_data) functionality).

* **`blocked_accounts.txt.gz`:** A gzip-compressed list of blocked account IDs
    * You can access the account of a given ID `#####` via the URL `https://twitter.com/intent/user?user_id=#####`
